/// these objects (the view tree) as the primary interface for expressing UI.
/// The view tree is transitory and is retained only long enough to dispatch
/// events and then serve as a reference for diffing for the next view tree.
///
/// The framework will then run methods on these views to create the associated
/// state tree and widget tree, as well as incremental updates and event
/// propagation.
///
/// The `View` trait is parameterized by `T`, which is known as the "app state",
/// and also a type for actions which are passed up the tree in event
/// propagation. During event handling, mutable access to the app state is
/// given to view nodes, which in turn can make expose it to callbacks.
