/// Options for file dialogs.
///
/// File dialogs let the user choose a specific path to open or save.
///
/// By default the file dialogs operate in *files mode* where the user can only choose files.
/// Importantly these are files from the user's perspective, but technically the returned path
/// will be a directory when the user chooses a package. You can read more about [packages] below.
/// It's also possible for users to manually specify a path which they might otherwise not be able
/// to choose. Thus it is important to verify that all the returned paths match your expectations.
///
/// The open dialog can also be switched to *directories mode* via [`select_directories`].
///
/// # Cross-platform compatibility
///
/// You could write platform specific code that really makes the best use of each platform.
/// However if you want to write universal code that will work on all platforms then
/// you have to keep some restrictions in mind.
///
/// ## Don't depend on directories with extensions
///
/// Your application should avoid having to deal with directories that have extensions
/// in their name, e.g. `my_stuff.pkg`. This clashes with [packages] on macOS and you
/// will either need platform specific code or a degraded user experience on macOS
/// via [`packages_as_directories`].
///
/// ## Use the save dialog only for new paths
///
/// Don't direct the user to choose an existing file with the save dialog.
/// Selecting existing files for overwriting is possible but extremely cumbersome on macOS.
/// The much more optimized flow is to have the user select a file with the open dialog
/// and then keep saving to that file without showing a save dialog.
/// Use the save dialog only for selecting a new location.
///
/// # macOS
///
/// The file dialog works a bit differently on macOS. For a lot of applications this doesn't matter
/// and you don't need to know the details. However if your application makes extensive use
/// of file dialogs and you target macOS then you should understand the macOS specifics.
///
/// ## Packages
///
/// On macOS directories with known extensions are considered to be packages, e.g. `app_files.pkg`.
/// Furthermore the packages are divided into two groups based on their extension.
/// First there are packages that have been defined at the OS level, and secondly there are
/// packages that are defined at the file dialog level based on [`allowed_types`].
/// These two types have slightly different behavior in the file dialogs. Generally packages
/// behave similarly to regular files in many contexts, including the file dialogs.
/// This package concept can be turned off in the file dialog via [`packages_as_directories`].
///
/// &#xFEFF; | Packages as files. File filters apply to packages. | Packages as directories.
/// -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------
/// Open directory | Not selectable. Not traversable. | Selectable. Traversable.
/// Open file | Selectable. Not traversable. | Not selectable. Traversable.
/// Save file | OS packages [clickable] but not traversable.<br/>Dialog packages traversable but not selectable. | Not selectable. Traversable.
///
/// Keep in mind that the file dialog may start inside any package if the user has traversed
/// into one just recently. The user might also manually specify a path inside a package.
///
/// Generally this behavior should be kept, because it's least surprising to macOS users.
/// However if your application requires selecting directories with extensions as directories
/// or the user needs to be able to traverse into them to select a specific file,
/// then you can change the default behavior via [`packages_as_directories`]
/// to force macOS to behave like other platforms and not give special treatment to packages.
///
/// ## Selecting files for overwriting in the save dialog is cumbersome
///
/// Existing files can be clicked on in the save dialog, but that only copies their base file name.
/// If the clicked file's extension is different than the first extension of the default type
/// then the returned path does not actually match the path of the file that was clicked on.
/// Clicking on a file doesn't change the base path either. Keep in mind that the macOS file dialog
/// can have several directories open at once. So if a user has traversed into `/Users/Joe/foo/`
/// and then clicks on an existing file `/Users/Joe/old.txt` in another directory then the returned
/// path will actually be `/Users/Joe/foo/old.rtf` if the default type's first extension is `rtf`.
///
/// ## Have a really good save dialog default type
///
/// There is no way for the user to choose which extension they want to save a file as via the UI.
/// They have no way of knowing which extensions are even supported and must manually type it out.
///
/// *Hopefully it's a temporary problem and we can find a way to show the file formats in the UI.
/// This is being tracked in [druid#998].*
