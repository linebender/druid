// # Notes on error handling in X11
//
// In XCB, errors are reported asynchronously by default, by sending them to the event
// loop. You can also request a synchronous error for a given call; we use this in
// window initialization, but otherwise we take the async route.
//
// When checking for X11 errors synchronously, there are two places where the error could
// happen. An error on the request means the connection is broken. There's no need for
// extra error context here, because the fact that the connection broke has nothing to do
// with what we're trying to do. An error on the reply means there was something wrong with
// the request, and so we add context. This convention is used throughout the x11 backend.
