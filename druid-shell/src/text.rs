//! Types and functions for cross-platform text input.
//!
//! Text input is a notoriously difficult problem.  Unlike many other aspects of
//! user interfaces, text input can not be correctly modeled using discrete
//! events passed from the platform to the application. For example, many mobile
//! phones implement autocorrect: when the user presses the spacebar, the
//! platform peeks at the word directly behind the caret, and potentially
//! replaces it if it's mispelled. This means the platform needs to know the
//! contents of a text field. On other devices, the platform may need to draw an
//! emoji window under the caret, or look up the on-screen locations of letters
//! for crossing out with a stylus, both of which require fetching on-screen
//! coordinates from the application.
//!
//! This is all to say: text editing is a bidirectional conversation between the
//! application and the platform. The application, when the platform asks for
//! it, serves up text field coordinates and content.  The platform looks at
//! this information and combines it with input from keyboards (physical or
//! onscreen), voice, styluses, the user's language settings, and then sends
//! edit commands to the application.
//!
//! Many platforms have an additional complication: this input fusion often
//! happens in a different process from your application. If we don't
//! specifically account for this fact, we might get race conditions!  In the
//! autocorrect example, if I sloppily type "meoow" and press space, the
//! platform might issue edits to "delete backwords one word and insert meow".
//! However, if I concurrently click somewhere else in the document to move the
//! caret, this will replace some *other* word with "meow", and leave the
//! "meoow" disappointingly present. To mitigate this problem, we use locks,
//! represented by the `InputHandler` trait.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle of a Text Input
//!
//! 1. The user clicks a link or switches tabs, and the window content now
//!    contains a new text field.  The application registers this new field by
//!    calling `WindowHandle::add_text_field`, and gets a `TextFieldToken` that
//!    represents this new field.
//! 2. The user clicks on that text field, focusing it. The application lets the
//!    platform know by calling `WindowHandle::set_focused_text_field` with that
//!    field's `TextFieldToken`.
//! 3. The user presses a key on the keyboard. The platform first calls
//!    `WinHandler::key_down`. If this method returns `true`, the application
//!    has indicated the keypress was captured, and we skip the remaining steps.
//! 4. If `key_down` returned `false`, druid-shell forwards the key event to the
//!    platform's text input system
//! 5. The platform, in response to either this key event or some other user
//!    action, determines it's time for some text input. It calls
//!    `WinHandler::text_input` to acquire a lock on the text field's state.
//!    The application returns an `InputHandler` object corresponding to the
//!    requested text field. To prevent race conditions, your application may
//!    not make any changes
//!    to the text field's state until the platform drops the `InputHandler`.
//! 6. The platform calls various `InputHandler` methods to inspect and edit the
//!    text field's state. Later, usually within a few milliseconds, the
//!    platform drops the `InputHandler`, allowing the application to once again
//!    make changes to the text field's state. These commands might be "insert
//!    `q`" for a smartphone user tapping on their virtual keyboard, or
//!    "move the caret one word left" for a user pressing the left arrow key
//!    while holding control.
//! 7. Eventually, after many keypresses cause steps 3â€“6 to repeat, the user
//!    unfocuses the text field. The application indicates this to the platform
//!    by calling `set_focused_text_field`.  Note that even though focus has
//!    shifted away from our text field, the platform may still send edits to it
//!    by calling `WinHandler::text_input`.
//! 8. At some point, the user clicks a link or switches a tab, and the text
//!    field is no longer present in the window.  The application calls
//!    `WindowHandle::remove_text_field`, and the platform may no longer call
//!    `WinHandler::text_input` to make changes to it.
//!
//! The application also has a series of steps it follows if it wants to make
//! its own changes to the text field's state:
//!
//! 1. The application determines it would like to make a change to the text
//!    field; perhaps the user has scrolled and and the text field has changed
//!    its visible location on screen, or perhaps the user has clicked to move
//!    the caret to a new location.
//! 2. The application first checks to see if there's an outstanding
//!    `InputHandler` lock for this text field; if so, it waits until the last
//!    `InputHandler` is dropped before continuing.
//! 3. The application then makes the change to the text input. If the change
//!    would affect state visible from an `InputHandler`, the application must
//!    notify the platform via `WinHandler::update_text_field`.
//!
//! ## Supported Platforms
//!
//! Currently, `druid-shell` text input is fully implemented on macOS. Our goal
//! is to have full support for all druid-shell targets, but for now,
//! `InputHandler` calls are simulated from keypresses on other platforms, which
//! doesn't allow for IME input, dead keys, etc.
