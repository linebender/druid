# The default clippy value for this is 8 bytes, which is chosen to improve performance on 32-bit.
# Given that druid is being designed for the future and already even mobile phones have 64-bit CPUs,
# it makes sense to optimize for 64-bit and accept the performance hits on 32-bit.
# 16 bytes is the number of bytes that fits into two 64-bit CPU registers.
