### Outside News

## [0.6.0] - 2020-06-01

### Highlights

#### X11 backend for druid-shell.

[@crsaracco] got us started and implemented basic support to run druid on bare-metal X11 in [#599].
Additional features got fleshed out in [#894] and [#900] by [@xStrom]
and in [#920], [#961], and [#982] by [@jneem].

While still incomplete this lays the foundation for running druid on Linux without relying on GTK.

#### Web backend for druid-shell.

[@elrnv] continued the work of [@tedsta] and implemented a mostly complete web backend
via WebAssembly (Wasm) in [#759] and enabled all druid examples to
[run in the browser](https://elrnv.github.io/druid-wasm-examples/).

While some features like the clipboard, menus or file dialogs are not yet available,
all fundamental features are there.

#### Using Core Graphics on macOS.

[@cmyr] continued the work of [@jrmuizel] and implemented Core Graphics support for Piet in
[piet#176](https://github.com/linebender/piet/pull/176).

Those changes made it into druid via [#905].
This means that druid no longer requires cairo on macOS and uses Core Graphics instead.

### Added

- `Command` and `Selector` have been reworked and are now statically typed, similarly to `Env` and `Key`. ([#993] by [@finnerale])
- `AppDelegate::command` now receives a `Target` instead of a `&Target`. ([#909] by [@xStrom])
- `SHOW_WINDOW` and `CLOSE_WINDOW` commands now only use `Target` to determine the affected window. ([#928] by [@finnerale])
