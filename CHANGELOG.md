# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Highlights

#### Basic X11 backend for druid-shell. ([#599])

[@crsaracco] has implemented basic support to run druid on bare-metal X11!

While still incomplete this lays the foundation for running druid on Linux without relying on GTK.

#### Mostly complete Wasm backend for druid-shell. ([#759])

[@elrnv] continued the work of [@tedsta] and implemented a mostly complete Wasm backend and enabled
all druid examples to [run in the browser](https://elrnv.github.io/druid-wasm-examples/).

While some features like the clipboard, menus or file dialogs are not yet available,
all fundamental features are there.

#### Using Core Graphics on macOS. ([#905])

[@cmyr] continued the work of [@jrmuizel] and implemented Core Graphics support for piet in
[piet#176](https://github.com/linebender/piet/pull/176).

Those changes made it into druid via [#905].
This means that druid no longer requires cairo on macOS and uses Core Graphics instead.
