## [0.6.0] - 2020-06-01

### Highlights

#### X11 backend for druid-shell.

[@crsaracco] got us started and implemented basic support to run Druid on bare-metal X11 in [#599].
Additional features got fleshed out in [#894] and [#900] by [@xStrom]
and in [#920], [#961], and [#982] by [@jneem].

While still incomplete this lays the foundation for running Druid on Linux without relying on GTK.

#### Web backend for druid-shell.

[@elrnv] continued the work of [@tedsta] and implemented a mostly complete web backend
via WebAssembly (Wasm) in [#759] and enabled all Druid examples to
[run in the browser](https://elrnv.github.io/druid-wasm-examples/).

While some features like the clipboard, menus or file dialogs are not yet available,
all fundamental features are there.

#### Using Core Graphics on macOS.

[@cmyr] continued the work of [@jrmuizel] and implemented Core Graphics support for Piet in
[piet#176](https://github.com/linebender/piet/pull/176).

Those changes made it into Druid via [#905].
This means that Druid no longer requires Cairo on macOS and uses Core Graphics instead.
