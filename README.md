Druid is an experimental Rust-native UI toolkit. Its main goal is to offer a
polished user experience. There are many factors to this goal, including
performance, a rich palette of interactions (hence a widget library to support
them), and playing well with the native platform.
See the [goals section](#Goals) for more details.

Druid's current development is largely driven by its use in [Runebender], a new
font editor.

We have been doing periodic releases of Druid on crates.io, but it is under
active development and its API might change. All changes are documented
in [the changelog](https://github.com/linebender/druid/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

For an overview of some key concepts, see the (work in progress) [Druid book].

## Contributions

A very good place to ask questions and discuss development work is our [Zulip
chat instance], in the #druid-help and #druid channels, respectively.

We gladly accept contributions via GitHub pull requests. Please see
[CONTRIBUTING.md] for more details.

## Example

Here's a simple counter example app.

```rust
use druid::widget::{Button, Flex, Label};
use druid::{AppLauncher, LocalizedString, PlatformError, Widget, WidgetExt, WindowDesc};

fn main() -> Result<(), PlatformError> {
    let main_window = WindowDesc::new(ui_builder());
    let data = 0_u32;
    AppLauncher::with_window(main_window)
        .use_simple_logger()
        .launch(data)
}

fn ui_builder() -> impl Widget<u32> {
    // The label text will be computed dynamically based on the current locale and count
    let text =
        LocalizedString::new("hello-counter").with_arg("count", |data: &u32, _env| (*data).into());
    let label = Label::new(text).padding(5.0).center();
    let button = Button::new("increment")
        .on_click(|_ctx, data, _env| *data += 1)
        .padding(5.0);

    Flex::column().with_child(label).with_child(button)
}
```

## Using Druid

An explicit goal of Druid is to be easy to build, so please open an issue if you
run into any difficulties. Druid is available on [crates.io] and should work as
a lone dependency (it re-exports all the parts of `druid-shell`, `piet`, and `kurbo`
that you'll need):

```toml
druid = "0.7.0"
```

Since Druid is currently in fast-evolving state, you might prefer to drink from
the firehose:

```toml
druid = { git = "https://github.com/linebender/druid.git" }
```

### Platform notes

#### Linux

On Linux, Druid requires gtk+3; see [GTK installation page]. 
(On ubuntu-based distro, running `sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev` from the terminal will do the job.)


Alternatively, there is an X11 backend available, although it is currently
[missing quite a few features](https://github.com/linebender/druid/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ashell%2Fx11+label%3Amissing).
You can try it out with `--features=x11`.

## Goals

Druid's goal is to make it easy to write and deploy high quality desktop
applications with a smooth and polished user experience on all common
platforms. In order to achieve this we strive for a variety of things:

- Make it easy to build and package on all supported platforms.
- Implement abstractions to avoid platform specific quirks.
- Respect platform conventions and expectations.
- Handle display resolution and scaling reliably with little effort.
- Enable easy, yet powerful internationalization.
- Offer robust accessibility support.
- Produce small and fast binaries with low memory usage.
- Have a small dependency tree, a high quality code base and good organization.
- Focus on powerful, desktop-grade applications.
- Provide a flexible set of layouts and common widgets.
- Ease creation of custom components and application logic as needed.

### Non-Goals

In order to fulfill those goals, we cannot support every use case. Luckily
the Rust community is working on a variety of different libraries with
different goals, so here are some of Druid's non-goals and possible
alternatives that can offer those capabilities:

- Use the the platform-native widgets or mimic them. ([Relm])
- Embed easily into custom render pipelines. ([Conrod])
- Adhere to a specific architectural style such as Elm. ([Iced], [Relm])
- Support rendering to HTML when targeting the web. ([Iced], [Moxie])

Druid is just one of many ongoing [Rust-native GUI experiments]. If it
doesn't suit your use case, perhaps one of the others will!

## Concepts

### druid-shell

The Druid toolkit uses `druid-shell` for a platform-abstracting application shell.
`druid-shell` is responsible for starting a native platform runloop, listening to
events, converting them into a platform-agnostic representation, and calling a
user-provided handler with them.

While `druid-shell` is being developed with the Druid toolkit in mind, it is
intended to be general enough that it could be reused by other projects
interested in experimenting with Rust GUI. The `druid-shell` crate includes a
couple of [non-`druid` examples].

### piet

Druid relies on the [Piet library] for drawing and text layout. Piet is a 2D graphics
abstraction with multiple backends: `piet-direct2d`, `piet-coregraphics`, `piet-cairo`,
`piet-web`, and `piet-svg` are currently available, and a GPU backend is planned.
In terms of Druid platform support via Piet, macOS uses `piet-coregraphics`,
Linux uses `piet-cairo`, Windows uses `piet-direct2d`, and web uses `piet-web`.

```rust
use druid::kurbo::{BezPath, Point, Rect};
use druid::piet::Color;

// Create an arbitrary bezier path
// (ctx.size() returns the size of the layout rect we're painting in)
let mut path = BezPath::new();
path.move_to(Point::ORIGIN);
path.quad_to(
    (80.0, 90.0),
    (ctx.size().width, ctx.size().height),
);
// Create a color
let stroke_color = Color::rgb8(0x00, 0x80, 0x00);
// Stroke the path with thickness 1.0
ctx.stroke(path, &stroke_color, 1.0);

// Rectangles: the path for practical people
let rect = Rect::from_origin_size((10., 10.), (100., 100.));
// Note the Color:rgba8 which includes an alpha channel (7F in this case)
let fill_color = Color::rgba8(0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x7F);
ctx.fill(rect, &fill_color);
```

### widgets

Widgets in Druid (text boxes, buttons, layout components, etc.) are objects
which implement the [Widget trait]. The trait is parametrized by a type (`T`)
for associated data. All trait methods (`event`, `lifecycle`, `update`, `paint`,
and `layout`) are provided with access to this data, and in the case of
`event` the reference is mutable, so that events can directly update the data.

Whenever the application data changes, the framework traverses the widget
hierarchy with an `update` method.

All the widget trait methods are provided with a corresponding context
([EventCtx], [LifeCycleCtx], [UpdateCtx], [LayoutCtx], [PaintCtx]). The widget can request
things and cause actions by calling methods on that context.

In addition, all trait methods are provided with an environment `Env`, which
includes the current theme parameters (colors, dimensions, etc.).

```rust
impl<T: Data> Widget<T> for Button<T> {
    fn event(&mut self, ctx: &mut EventCtx, event: &Event, data: &mut T, env: &Env) {
      ...
    }

    fn lifecycle(&mut self, ctx: &mut LifeCycleCtx, event: &LifeCycle, data: &T, env: &Env) {
      ...
    }

    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut UpdateCtx, old_data: &T, data: &T, env: &Env) {
      ...
    }

    fn layout(&mut self, ctx: &mut LayoutCtx, bc: &BoxConstraints, data: &T, env: &Env) -> Size {
      ...
    }

    fn paint(&mut self, ctx: &mut PaintCtx, data: &T, env: &Env) {
      ...
    }
}
```

Druid provides a number of [basic utility and layout widgets] and it's easy to
implement your own. You can also compose widgets into new widgets:

```rust
fn build_widget() -> impl Widget<u32> {
    let mut col = Flex::column();
    for i in 0..30 {
        let button = Button::new(format!("Button {}", i).padding(5.0);
        col.add_child(button, 0.0);
    }
    Scroll::new(col)
}
```

### layout

Druid's layout protocol is strongly inspired by [Flutter's box layout model].
In Druid, widgets are passed a `BoxConstraint` that provides them a minimum and
maximum size for layout. Widgets are also responsible for computing appropriate
constraints for their children if applicable.

### data

Druid uses a [Data trait] to represent [value types]. These should be cheap to
compare and cheap to clone.

In general, you can use `derive` to generate a `Data` impl for your types.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Data)]
struct AppState {
    which: bool,
    value: f64,
}
```

### lens

The [Lens datatype] gives access to a part of a larger data structure. Like
`Data`, this can be derived. Derived lenses are accessed as associated constants
with the same name as the field.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Data, Lens)]
struct AppState {
    which: bool,
    value: f64,
}
```

To use the lens, wrap your widget with `LensWrap` (note the conversion of
CamelCase to snake_case):

```rust
LensWrap::new(WidgetThatExpectsf64::new(), AppState::value);
```

Alternatively, lenses for structs, tuples, and indexable containers can be
constructed on-demand with the `lens` macro:

```rust
LensWrap::new(WidgetThatExpectsf64::new(), lens!(AppState, value));
```

This is particularly useful when working with types defined in another crate.
