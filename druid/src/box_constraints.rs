/// The layout strategy for druid is strongly inspired by Flutter,
/// and this struct is similar to the [Flutter BoxConstraints] class.
///
/// At the moment, it represents simply a minimum and maximum size.
/// A widget's [`layout`] method should choose an appropriate size that
/// meets these constraints.
///
/// Further, a container widget should compute appropriate constraints
/// for each of its child widgets, and pass those down when recursing.
///
/// The constraints are always [rounded away from zero] to integers
/// to enable pixel perfect layout.
