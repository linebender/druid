/// An event, propagated downwards during event flow.
///
/// Events are things that happen that can change the state of widgets.
/// An important category is events plumbed from the platform windowing
/// system, which includes mouse and keyboard events, but also (in the
/// future) status changes such as window focus changes.
///
/// Events can also be higher level concepts indicating state changes
/// within the widget hierarchy, for example when a widget gains or loses
/// focus or "hot" (also known as hover) status.
///
/// Events are a key part of what is called "event flow", which is
/// basically the propagation of an event through the widget hierarchy
/// through the [`event`] widget method. A container widget will
/// generally pass the event to its children, mediated through the
/// [`WidgetPod`] container, which is where most of the event flow logic
/// is applied (especially the decision whether or not to propagate).
///
/// This enum is expected to grow considerably, as there are many, many
/// different kinds of events that are relevant in a GUI.
