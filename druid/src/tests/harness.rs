/// attempt to dispatch any `Command`s that are sent during event handling, and

/// in `AppState`: for instance it does not clear the `needs_inval` and
/// `children_changed` flags on the window after an update.
///

/// because paint is triggered by druid-shell, and there is no druid-shell here;
///
/// if you want those functions run you will need to call them yourself.
