/// All trait methods are provided with access to this data, and
/// in the case of `event` the reference is mutable, so that events
/// can directly update the data.
///
/// Whenever the application data changes, the framework traverses
/// the widget hierarchy with an [`update`] method. The framework

/// is why `T` has a [`Data`] bound.

/// All the trait methods are provided with a corresponding context.
/// The widget can request things and cause actions by calling methods
/// on that context.

/// In addition, all trait methods are provided with an environment

/// on their child widgets, but rather will own their widget wrapped in
/// a [`WidgetPod`], and call the corresponding method on that. The

/// other hand, particularly light-weight containers might contain their
/// child `Widget` directly (when no layout or event flow logic is
/// needed), and in those cases will call these methods.
