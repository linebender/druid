/// and passing a `WidgetId` as the [`Target`].
///
/// A widget can retrieve its id via methods on the various contexts, such as

///
/// Sometimes, you may want to know a widget's id when constructing the widget.
/// You can give a widget an _explicit_ id by wrapping it in an [`IdentityWrapper`]
/// widget, or by using the [`WidgetExt::with_id`] convenience method.
///
/// If you set a `WidgetId` directly, you are resposible for ensuring that it
/// is unique in time. That is: only one widget can exist with a given id at a
/// given time.

/// The trait implemented by all widgets.

/// All appearance and behavior for a widget is encapsulated in an
/// object that implements this trait.
///
/// The trait is parametrized by a type (`T`) for associated data.
/// All trait methods are provided with access to this data, and
/// in the case of [`event`] the reference is mutable, so that events
/// can directly update the data.
///
/// Whenever the application data changes, the framework traverses
/// the widget hierarchy with an [`update`] method. The framework
/// needs to know whether the data has actually changed or not, which
/// is why `T` has a [`Data`] bound.
///
/// All the trait methods are provided with a corresponding context.
/// The widget can request things and cause actions by calling methods
/// on that context.
///
/// In addition, all trait methods are provided with an environment
/// ([`Env`]).
///
/// Container widgets will generally not call `Widget` methods directly
/// on their child widgets, but rather will own their widget wrapped in
/// a [`WidgetPod`], and call the corresponding method on that. The
/// `WidgetPod` contains state and logic for these traversals. On the
/// other hand, particularly light-weight containers might contain their
/// child `Widget` directly (when no layout or event flow logic is
/// needed), and in those cases will call these methods.
///
/// As a general pattern, container widgets will call the corresponding
/// `WidgetPod` method on all their children. The `WidgetPod` applies
/// logic to determine whether to recurse, as needed.
