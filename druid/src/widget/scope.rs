/// A widget that allows encapsulation of application state.

/// This is useful in circumstances where
/// * A (potentially reusable) widget is composed of a tree of multiple cooperating child widgets
/// * Those widgets communicate amongst themselves using Druid's reactive data mechanisms
/// * It is undesirable to complicate the surrounding application state with the internal details
///   of the widget.
///
///
/// Examples include:
/// * In a tabs widget composed of a tab bar, and a widget switching body, those widgets need to
///   cooperate on which tab is selected. However not every user of a tabs widget wishes to
///   encumber their application state with this internal detail - especially as many tabs widgets may
///   reasonably exist in an involved application.
/// * In a table/grid widget composed of various internal widgets, many things need to be synchronised.
///   Scroll position, heading moves, drag operations, sort/filter operations. For many applications
///   access to this internal data outside of the table widget isn't needed.
///   For this reason it may be useful to use a Scope to establish private state.
///
/// A scope embeds some input state (from its surrounding application or parent scope)
/// into a larger piece of internal state. This is controlled by a user provided policy.
///
/// The ScopePolicy needs to do two things
/// a) Create a new scope from the initial value of its input,
/// b) Provide two way synchronisation between the input and the state via a ScopeTransfer
///
/// Convenience methods are provided to make a policy from a function and a lens.
/// It may sometimes be advisable to implement ScopePolicy directly if you need to
/// mention the type of a Scope.
///
