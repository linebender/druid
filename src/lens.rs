/// A lens is a datatype that gives access to a part of a larger
/// data structure.
///
/// A simple example of a lens is a field of a struct; in this case,
/// the lens itself is zero-sized. Another case is accessing an array
/// element, in which case the lens contains the array index.
///
/// Many `Lens` implementations will be derived by macro, but custom
/// implementations are practical as well.
///
/// The name "lens" is inspired by the [Haskell lens] package, which
/// has generally similar goals. It's likely we'll develop more
/// sophistication, for example combinators to combine lenses.
///

    ///
    /// Discussion question: using a closure as in the [`with_mut`]
    /// method may improve flexibility (for example, being able to
    /// synthesize derived data on the fly). Is this flexibility worth
    /// the increased complexity?

    /// yielding a mutable reference, because it is intended to be used
    /// with value-type data (also known as immutable data structures).
    /// For example, a lens for an immutable list might be implemented by
    /// cloning the list, giving the closure mutable access to the clone,
    /// then updating the reference after the closure returns.

// A case can be made this should be in the `widget` module.

/// A wrapper for its widget subtree to have access to a part
/// of its parent's data.
///
/// Every widget in druid is instantiated with access to data of some
/// type; the root widget has access to the entire application data.
/// Often, a part of the widget hierarchy is only concerned with a part
/// of that data. The `LensWrap` widget is a way to "focus" the data
/// reference down, for the subtree. One advantage is performance;
/// data changes that don't intersect the scope of the lens aren't
/// propagated.
///
/// Another advantage is generality and reuse. If a widget (or tree of
/// widgets) is designed to work with some chunk of data, then with a
/// lens that same code can easily be reused across all occurrences of
/// that chunk within the application state.
///
/// This wrapper takes a [`Lens`] as an argument, which is a specification
/// of a struct field, or some other way of narrowing the scope.
